# Simple Deno server using Oak as a frame work

Deno as a new runtime for Javascript/TypeScript.
It was created by Ryan Dahl, same creator of Node js.

Deno is a new tool to use and is still in it early days. This is a example of how you could use Deno with Oak as a framework, similar to Koa in Node Js

This is a simple server , if you are used to work with Node and express js then it is very similar. I think Deno will get a big hype in the feature and definitely think it's a great bet. Another thing that I really like with Deno is that it's built with Typescript! 🚀🏆
